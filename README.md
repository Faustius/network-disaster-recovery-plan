## 📖 Overview
When a server crashes or ransomware hits, IQ points drop by 50%. Panic sets in.
You do not need a 100-page manual that no one will read. You need a **Checklist**.

This repository contains the **Monadic 'Red Binder' Protocol**—a minimalist Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) designed for Small to Mid-Sized Businesses.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  **Fork** this repository (or copy the `recovery-template.md` file).
2.  **Fill in** the bracketed information `[ ]` specific to your company.
3.  **Print it out.** (A digital DRP is useless if your computer is encrypted).
4.  **Test it.** Run a drill once a year.

## 🛡️ Philosophy
Clarity over Complexity.
In an emergency, you need simple "If This, Then That" logic.
